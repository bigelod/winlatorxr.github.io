          <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/37320/winlatorxr" target="_blank"><strong>SideQuest VR</strong></a> is the platform where WinlatorXR is officially listed and distributed. Unlike traditional app marketplaces such as the Meta Quest Store, SideQuest provides a more flexible environment for developers who need deeper access to system-level features.
        </p>
        <p>
          WinlatorXR is not available on official stores due to their strict policies regarding the use of certain Android APIs and advanced system functionalities. These restrictions, while designed to ensure security and consistency, can significantly limit apps that rely on low-level system integration or extended platform capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          By being available on SideQuest, WinlatorXR can fully leverage the features it was designed to use—without compromising performance or functionality. SideQuest enables true cross-platform support and allows us to maintain the complete experience as intended, free from the limitations imposed by more restrictive storefront policies.
