          <strong>WinlatorXR</strong> is a next-generation Windows compatibility environment
          built specifically for Extended Reality (XR). It enables users to run full Windows
          applications and games inside immersive VR and AR spaces—bringing the power of
          desktop software into a spatial, interactive world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Designed for performance and flexibility, WinlatorXR bridges the gap between
          traditional Windows programs and modern XR headsets. Whether you're launching
          productivity tools, creative software, or classic PC games, WinlatorXR transforms
          them into immersive experiences optimized for virtual environments.

  <h1>Supported headsets</h1>
  <p>
    Although the Quest 3 and Quest 3 S remain the most popular headsets for running WinlatorXR, our compatibility extends well beyond Meta’s ecosystem. The Pico 4 Ultra, for example, is a strong alternative. Thanks to its Turnip driver support, it can deliver slightly better performance than the Quest 3 in many scenarios. The base Pico 4 model, however, lacks a crucial Vulkan extension; as a result, it can run only DirectX 7 and DirectX 8 titles, and we currently consider it effectively unsupported. Surprisingly, the older Meta Quest 2 continues to perform admirably. With the Turnip driver enabled, it offers full compatibility and often works far better than expected for a device of its generation.
  <p/>
  <p>
    We’ve also benefited from community contributions. A developer from Play for Dream kindly added support for the Play for Dream MR headset. While this support remains in the project, we cannot guarantee long-term reliability, as we do not have access to the hardware for continuous testing.

  <h1>History</h1>
  <h2>Project Background</h2>
  <p>
  Between <strong>2022</strong> and <strong>2024</strong>, the lead developer of WinlatorXR
  focused extensively on advancing immersive emulation for standalone VR headsets.
  In 2022, he introduced <strong>PPSSPP VR</strong>, bringing stereoscopic 3D rendering
  and head tracking to classic handheld titles. In 2023, he revived the
  <strong>VirtualGoBoy</strong> emulator, making it working on newer Android versions.
  Continuing this trajectory in 2024, he contributed to <strong>CitraVR</strong>
  by implementing an immersive mode that significantly enhanced
  Nintendo 3DS emulation within VR environments. Together, these projects
  demonstrated a consistent effort to expand VR-native emulation and improve
  spatial presence across multiple platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
  After discovering the <strong>Winlator</strong> project, the developer immediately
  recognized its potential and initiated contact to explore the integration of
  <strong>OpenXR</strong> support. The objective was to enable standardized VR runtime
  compatibility and extend immersive capabilities within the Windows container
  environment. However, the original repository proved challenging for external open-source
  collaboration. Limited flexibility for community contributions led to the
  creation of multiple independent forks and mods of the project.
  These forks focused on experimentation, feature expansion, and improved
  integration paths, ultimately contributing to the growth and diversification
  of the ecosystem surrounding the project.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Evolution</h2>
  <p>
  Initially, there was no intention to create an independent fork or modification of WinlatorXR.
  The project existed as part of the official Winlator repository, with the goal of contributing
  VR functionality directly upstream. However, frequent Quest OS updates repeatedly broke
  compatibility, and the time required to implement hotfixes proved to be too long for a
  stable and reliable development cycle. Over time, it became clear that relying solely on
  the original repository structure was not a sustainable solution.
  </p>

  <p>
  The emergence of the GLIBC fork marked a significant turning point. This fork delivered
  a substantial performance improvement, and its maintainer — a Chinese student developer —
  quickly granted administrative access to the lead developer. This collaboration proved
  to be mutually beneficial and accelerated development. Unfortunately, the original
  maintainer later disappeared from the internet, leaving the project without consistent
  upstream updates or long-term maintenance.
  Meanwhile, Tobbe85 introduced a separate fork that added support for Pico headsets.
  This broadened hardware compatibility and brought increased visibility to the project.
  Around the same time, GmoLargey became heavily involved as a primary tester of early
  WinlatorXR builds, providing valuable feedback and helping refine stability and
  performance during critical development stages.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the summer of 2025, the release of Winlator Cmod/Bionic resolved long-standing
  issues related to Meta Quest drivers and unlocked compatibility with DirectX 9
  and newer titles. This development represented a major breakthrough. The lead
  developer merged these improvements together with Tobbe85’s work, effectively
  rebooting the project and establishing a stronger, more unified foundation for
  future WinlatorXR development.
